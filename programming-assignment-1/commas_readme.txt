================================ Questions ==================================

1. 3 becuase 'int' at most have 10 digits (2^31-1 & -2^32), which have 
   3 commas.
   
2. Yes becuase the 0 case does not qualify the condition in the following
   loops. Then I just made it directly output 0 if the input is 0.

3. Have to print out each digit in the order from left to right.
