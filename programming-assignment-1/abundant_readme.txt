================================ Questions ==================================

1. I used a while loop to iterate through the input numbers because we 
have to keep cin'ing each input number until an 0 occurs. This gives us 
the while condition which is while input doesn't equal 0.

2. I used a for loop to find the proper divisors for a single input number
because I wanted to iterate through each number from 1 to input-1 which 
are the possible remainders of the number. Then we can find the proper
divisors by limiting the condition to when the remainder equals 0.
   
3. 
a) Moving-Window: to shift values when a larger number occurs.
b) Lookup Table: to determine the condition of "Moving Window," which
together with "Moving-Window" ranks the abundant numbers and their 
abundances for the largest three.
c) Map: to sum up every divisor when the remainder is 0.
