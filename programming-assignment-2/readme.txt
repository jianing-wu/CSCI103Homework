================================ Questions ==================================

1. Yes, I did. Functions printCard and cardValue are easier to implement when
using these arrays. I just directly passed in the indexes of these arrays to
get the values.

2. Yes, I did. I added void printDealerHand(int hand[], int numCards), which 
helped me to print the initial deal's hand with the first card hidden.

3. It does (N-1) swap operations. The only extra memory used is for the temporary
variable created for the swap operation. Other than that, there is no extra 
memory usage.


================================ Remarks ====================================

Filling in anything here is OPTIONAL.
